    "### Problem Description\n",
    "This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for classifying tweets. Given a tweet's text, we need to predict whether it's about a real disaster (1) or not (0). The challenge comes from tweets that use disaster-related words metaphorically rather than literally, like saying \"This song is fire!\" versus \"The building is on fire!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Structure\n",
    "Our dataset consists of tweets with labels:\n",
    "- Training set: 10,000 labeled tweets\n",
    "- Test set: 10,900 tweets for prediction\n",
    "- Features for each tweet:\n",
    "  - text: The actual tweet content\n",
    "  - keyword: A key term from the tweet (may be blank)\n",
    "  - location: Where the tweet was sent from (may be blank)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "The model's performance will be evaluated based on binary classification accuracy:\n",
    "- Predict 1 for real disaster tweets\n",
    "- Predict 0 for non-disaster tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "The final submission should be a CSV file with tweet IDs and their predicted labels."
